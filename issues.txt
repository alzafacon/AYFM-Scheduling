#I know there's a better way to track issues...

.csv and .sql are not in UTF-8 (instead in ANSI)
work on convert_csv.py (remove enrollment stuff; improve sql)

some of the sql populate files were moved. (I think that py scripts make those, so I need to make sure that the py scripts are writing the populate scripts in the correct place)

refactor:
	assignee -> publisher		   # not sure...
	works_on.assignment_id -> type_id  # name does not make sense
	person.id_person -> person.id	   # cleaner syntax, no loss of meaning

	add back ticks to sql where `section` appears # conflict: sql keyword


Separate the DataAccess project from the AssignmentPlanner

==============================================
Creating and maintaining the code responsible for implementing the object-relational mapping can be difficult. 
There tends to be a great deal of code supporting ORM. 
The ORM code is tightly coupled to the database schema.

The Data Access Object design pattern describes a class whose responsibility is to encapsulate a class’s ORM code. 
There is a DAO defined for every persistent entity class. 
The Customer entity is maintained by the class CustomerDAO. 

A DAO provides all the operations needed to CRUD instances of its entity class including specialized Selects. 


Data-Tier Services may not be needed. Since their primary purpose is to make transactions. The operation needed is simple so the service layer may not be necessary and direct access to the DAO is allowed.
Data-Tier is requiered when several DAOs are ussed to create ('assemble') an entity.
